- [ ] [Solving Merge Conflicts](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/solve-merge-conflicts)
- [ ] When you encounter a merge conflict, make sure to understand incoming code. Do not just accept your revision, the incoming revision or both revisions. Understand how the changes will affect the flow of the program. To lessen the occurence of merge conflicts, always synchronize your branch with the develop branch by 
    1. Commiting often in your branch
    1. Checking out the develop branch and pulling the latest from that branch
    1. Going back to your branch and then merging from develop to your branch
